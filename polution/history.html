    <p>
        Anand Consultants is the brain-child of Mr. Rakesh Shah who returned to India from the USA in 1977 after 
        completing his studies at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, followed by his Masterâ€™s at the Ivy 
        League University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA, and experience at Shield Alloy Corporation, New Jersey, 
        USA.
    </p>
    <p>
        The above-stated return to India happened during a period in which environmental issues had gained worldwide 
        prominence subsequent to the Stockholm Conference of 1972. This particular event highlighted the importance 
        of environmental-related issues and effects that were likely to surface in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is under this thought process that Anand Consultants was set up from scratch to provide environmental 
        engineering and related services to organizations, industries, and institutes in India. Developing the company 
        in a virgin field of activity (which was not generally even heard of) required a lot of convincing and 
        presentation to industry as well as regulatory authorities. At the same time, developing staff/personnel to an 
        adequate level of expertise and delegation of work required immense managerial input.
    </p>
    <p>
        Notwithstanding the above-stated difficulties, the efforts put in by Anand Consultants have borne fruit by way 
        of the company providing its services all over India as also in neighboring countries such as Afghanistan, 
        Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bhutan, and having an Ugandan company requesting assistance in the said field.
    </p>
    <p>
        A number of multi-nationals who would have otherwise used their own country services/expertise have also relied 
        upon and used the services of Anand Consultants. Our success has been due to our realization that the biggest 
        drawback related to corporate environmental issues is the lack of availability of the latest and current 
        information, which we have been able to fill up. This partly due to our international professional exposure.
